# Quantum Extremal Learning (QEL)
This is an implementation in Pennylane of the Quantum Extremal Learning algorithm  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02807.pdf).

## A note on usage
The scripts in the `visualize/` directory are meant for plotting of the final results. Before running them, make sure to
1. Create the `pkl/` and `figures/` directories
2. Populate `pkl/` by running `qel.py`.

All plots produced by the scripts in `visualize/` will be available in the `figures/` directory.
